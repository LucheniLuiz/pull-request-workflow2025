## This Changed my Life.
### getting in to politics and NGOs
When i was 16 i started to get organized in the unity of IG Metall. After that many things started to run in parallel. First things first i helped co-workers to stand in for their rights and got the loan that the company should have paid. Which sadly concluded in many law suits and trails with the works council.
After that i started also to get more inside of politics in general and started fund-raisings for refugees and other marginalized people by organizing so called "Soli"-Parties in several places.
### taking over a non-commercial youth-venue
After a few years of just organizing parties i started to think a little more about my personal impact. So i decided to join a collective of people that not only organizes parties, but rather take care and organize a full non-commercial available place for the youth in a nearby city.
### quitting my full time job to start studying
After 7 Years of full-time work in the earlier mentioned industrial company. I decided to try myself inside of the academic world. The start was really rough because i don't have a abitur or anything comparable. I had to do some special qualification Tests at KIT to be able to get in touch with the university.
After that i had to take several talks about my motivation etc. All this to start this journey. Aside from the struggle about qualification i also had to pay my rent etc and had to find a way how I willing to be able to afford the study itself.
